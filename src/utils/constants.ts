      trigger:"How far in advance should I book my trek or tour?",
      content:` We recommend booking at least 3-6 months in advance, especially
              for popular destinations and peak seasons (like spring and autumn
              for the Himalayas). This ensures availability for permits,
              flights, and the best guides. Last-minute bookings are sometimes
              possible, so please contact us.`

              who are fluent in English and have extensive knowledge of the
              terrain, culture, and first aid. They are passionate about sharing
              their homeland with you.`

      trigger:"What are the accommodation and food like?",
      content:`This depends on the trek. On camping treks, we provide
              high-quality tents and a dedicated kitchen crew who prepare
              nutritious and hearty meals. On teahouse/lodge treks, you'll stay
              in family-run lodges with basic, shared facilities and eat meals
              from their menus.`
